# My Website
Welcome to my Website. The website acts as a CV/Resume for myself and was designed as part of one of my University Assignments.
This website will be updated and maintain by self as soon as new information about me is released. Information such as current job or projects I am currently working on or contributing to, further more new technologies I have learned will be updated on my website.

The information below shows all the API's, references and technologies used to create this website. Information regarding challenges and Website thought and design process
